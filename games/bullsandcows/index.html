        <p> You need to guess a random four digit number.</p>
        <p> For each guess the game will tell you how many cows and bulls there are. </p>
        <p> One cow means that there is a digit in your guess, but at the wrong place. </p>
        <p> One bull means that there is a digit in your guess in the correct place. </p>
